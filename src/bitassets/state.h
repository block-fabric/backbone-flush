/**
 * Assets (BitAssets, after the sidechain of that name by LayerTwo Labs).
 *
 *  - An **asset** is registered under a name, in two steps as BitNames are (a
 *    **reservation** commits to the name under a secret nonce, a later
 *    **registration** reveals it), and is known on the chain by the SHA-256
 *    hash of the name. The registration creates its initial supply and its
 *    **control** coin: whoever holds the control coin mints more and changes
 *    the asset's data. Burning the control coin fixes the supply for good.
 *  - Asset coins, control coins, reservations, liquidity (LP) shares and
 *    auction receipts are **tokens**, carried by outputs of no value that a
 *    **marker** output (an OP_RETURN) lists, each with what it carries. Every
 *    token is accounted for: what a transaction spends, plus what its
 *    operation creates, is exactly what it outputs, plus what its operation
 *    takes in. Nothing is burned by accident.
 *  - **Pools** (a constant-product market maker, 0.3% to the liquidity
 *    providers) trade any two assets, CHN included. **Dutch auctions** sell an
 *    amount of one asset for another at a price that falls block by block.
 *  - CHN a transaction puts into a pool or an auction is burned by the marker
 *    (its value); CHN a pool or an auction pays out is paid by the coinbase of
 *    the block, as deposits are. Asset coins a pool or an auction pays out go
 *    to the **result** outputs the marker lists, in the amount the state
 *    gives when the block is connected, never less than the transaction asks.
